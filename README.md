# CloneCraft
A [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod developed by Jamezo97

Simply put, if you're lonely and have no friends, then do not fear; you can always be friends with your computer!
#####Yay!

##How to download
1. Go To the '[jar](https://github.com/Jamezo97/CloneCraft/tree/master/jar)' folder
2. When and if a full version is released, it will be available here
3. However for the time being, open the `Beta Versions` folder and click on the file for your minecraft version
4. Click `View Raw` to download the file. Chrome will say it can't be trusted, but that's okay, I forgive chrome.
