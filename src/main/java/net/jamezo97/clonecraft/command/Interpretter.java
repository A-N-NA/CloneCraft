	//A command, is defined by a unique subset of key words.
	//Key words are, for example, go, dig, build, kill, attack, jump, follow, stop, stay, guard, farm, come, give
	//With those key words defined and a command found, parameters are then needed. This is the hardest part.
	//Parameters are like, numbers, names, positions (there, here, next to me)
	//Once a command has the correctly specified parameter set, it may then begin executing
	//If it can't find all the info, it will ask directed questions, dependent on the parameter type.
	//i.e. How many blocks would you like? Where would you like me to go? (not "How many?" or "Where?", as this
	//provides no indication that the currently constructed command is what the user believes it to be)
